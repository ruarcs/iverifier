Just a simple thing I rigged up to see if I could implement
a method that could be added to the "__main__" of any module,
to check that all classes that claimed to implement interfaces
in fact did so fully.

Install using:
    python3 setup.py install

Run it using:
    cd demo
    python3 connector.py
